# Stormshield Custom Web Services Database

This database is collected from various sources eg. public IP/FQDN Databases, Vendor KB or just reverse engineering with Wireshark.

You can use this database free of charge for any purposes without any warranty.

Database is compatible with Stormshield Network Security Custom Web Services format.

#### Why am I creating this database?

Stormshield provides official Web Services signatures via their Active Update mechanism. It takes time to test everything before sharing service as official. There is my role to provide unofficial database of Web Services, so you can easily identify traffic destination from your network before Stormshield add them as official.

Any category from this database can disappear without any notice. If Stormshield releases official Web Service which will be overlapping then I will remove my unofficial Web Service.


I hope this will be useful for you.
